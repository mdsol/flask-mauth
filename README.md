# Flask MAuth

Flask-MAuth is a authentication library for Python server applications receiving MAuth signed requests.  

It is a Python port of the code in the [mauth-client-ruby](https://github.com/mdsol/mauth-client-ruby) repository.

For the moment, it uses the upstream [requests-mauth](https://github.com/mdsol/requests-mauth) client library.  We need to decide whether to move the code into the local repository.
